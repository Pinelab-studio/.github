# The art of good Pull Requests

Writing good PR's can be hard, so here are some tips ðŸ”§:

- **Write small, self-contained PR's** - Write PR's that just add a single feature. Adding multiple features? Split your PR into multiple PR's
- **Add test cases for new features** - Another developer should get an understanding of what the project is doing, by just reading the test cases.
- **Review your own PR** - Review your own PR before making it ready to review. This helps you catch simple things like typo's and unnecessary `console.log` statements.
- **Check the README**: Is it still up to date? Is your new feature documented?
