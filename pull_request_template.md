# The art of good Pull Requests

Writing good PR's can be hard, so here are some tips ðŸ”§:

- **Clear title** - Make sure the title of your PR reflects what the PR is about.
- **Small, self-contained PR's** - Write PR's that just add a single feature. Adding multiple features? Split your PR into multiple PR's
- **Automated tests** - Add or update  test cases according to the changes you've made. Another developer should get an understanding of what the project is doing, by just reading the test cases.
- **Review your own PR** - Review your own PR before making it ready to review. This helps you catch simple things like typo's, unnecessary `console.log` statements and commented code.
- **Check the README**: Is it still up to date? Is your new feature documented? Has something changed for the end user?
